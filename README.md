# Attendance Tracker

## Project Objective
This project is an attendance tracker developed in C++ as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course. It utilizes various data structures such as lists, nodes, and stacks to efficiently manage and track student attendance.

## Key Features
- **Template Classes:** Implemented using class templates for flexibility and reusability.
- **Data Structures:** Utilizes linked lists, nodes, and stacks to manage attendance records.
- **Efficient Operations:** Supports efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal of attendance data.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple command-line interface for easy interaction and management of attendance records.
- **Comprehensive Tracking:** Records detailed attendance information for students in a class.

## Technologies Used
- **C++:** Core programming language used for implementing the project.
- **Standard Template Library (STL):** Utilized for various data structures and algorithms.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attendance-tracker.git
   cd attendance-tracker
2. **Compile the Program:**
   Use the provided Makefile or a C++ compiler to build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   Alternatively, you can compile the program manually:
   ```bash
